## CV - [Johannes Plunien](mailto:johannes@plunien.com)

### Summary

- Working in Software Engineering since 2004, with focus on iOS since 8 years
- Had different roles from backend/frontend to DevOps to iOS engineer
- Living north of Munich with my wife and two daughters, working remotely for eBay Kleinanzeigen (Berlin) as an iOS Developer

I see myself as a generalist, not afraid to touch other technologies than what I was hired for. Often launching Android Studio, comparing the Android app to the iOS app in my current job to debug something, or to check with Charles Proxy how and when they make a request to the backend to ensure the two different platforms behave the same.

### Side Projects

#### Current
[simctl](https://github.com/plu/simctl) - Ruby interface to xcrun simctl (used by fastlane) - not very actively maintained, at least no new features are being added currently.

#### Past
Between 05/2017 and 07/2018 I've built and maintained the [iOS Poloniex App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/poloniex-crypto-exchange/id1234141021) (and [Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plunien.poloniex&hl=en&gl=US)) as my own product in my personal App Store Account. Was finally [acquired](https://www.circle.com/blog/announcing-the-official-poloniex-mobile-app) by Poloniex in 07/2018. Also started the Android App and implemented the first few screens, until I finally asked a [friend](https://github.com/CiprianU) for help, who  knows a lot more about Android than I do.

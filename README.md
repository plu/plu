## Summary

- Working in Software Engineering since 2004, with focus on iOS since 8 years
- Had different roles from backend/frontend to DevOps to iOS engineer
- Living north of Munich with my wife and two daughters, working remotely for eBay Kleinanzeigen in Berlin

I see myself as a generalist, not afraid to touch other technologies than what I was hired for.

## Side Projects

### Current
[simctl](https://github.com/plu/simctl) - Ruby interface to xcrun simctl (used by fastlane) - not very actively maintained, at least no new features are being added currently.

### Past
In 2017/2018 I've built and maintained the Poloniex [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/poloniex-crypto-exchange/id1234141021) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plunien.poloniex&hl=en&gl=US) (with help of a [friend](https://github.com/CiprianU)) app. It was [acquired](https://www.circle.com/blog/announcing-the-official-poloniex-mobile-app) by Poloniex in 2018.

In 2016 I was actively contributing to [idb](https://github.com/facebook/idb/commits?author=plu) (`FBSimulatorControl`) to achieve parallel execution of automated tests on the iOS Simulator, which did not support that out of the box back then.
